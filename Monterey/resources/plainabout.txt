Welcome to Monterey version 2.0.0 (beta)!  

Monterey is a FOSS ROV controller that is one of the modules of ROV-suite (http://sourceforge.net/p/rov-suite).  It is written to be simple to use and easy to modify.  After all, not everyone's ROV will have only 3 relays, 2 servos and 5 sensors.  Two main motor layouts are supported by default to give you, the user, support for both vector drive and tank drive configurations.  For controlling the ROV, a wide variety of joysticks are supported through the SDL library (www.libsdl.org).    My goal is to give you the best possible ROV controller for your ROV. 

The theme is a modified version of Dante Sanchez's theme for Flipp.

If you have any issues, questions, comments, ideas, etc, please contact me!

Thanks for trying it out!
