Welcome to Monterey version 3.0.0!

Monterey is a FOSS ROV controller that is one of the modules of ROV-suite (http://github.com/rovsuite).  It is written to be simple to use and easy to modify.  After all, not everyone's ROV will have only 3 relays, 2 servos and 5 sensors.  Two main motor layouts are supported by default to give you, the user, support for both vector drive and tank drive configurations.  For controlling the ROV, a wide variety of joysticks are supported through the SDL library (www.libsdl.org).    My goal is to give you the best possible ROV controller for your ROV.

The theme is a modified version of QuantumCD's Dark Fusion (contingencycoder.wordpress.com).

The graphing widget is QCustomPlot (qcustomplot.com).

If you have any issues, questions, comments, ideas, etc, please contact me!

Thanks for trying it out!
